# LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to the LeetCode Solutions repository! This is a community-driven collection of solutions to LeetCode problems in multiple programming languages.

## Contribution Guidelines

- **Choose the correct language directory**: Place your solution in the folder matching the language you used (e.g., `python`, `java`, `cpp`, `javascript`, `csharp`, `go`).
- **File naming convention**: Name your solution file as follows:
  
  `<problem-index>.<problem-name>-<yourusername>.<extension>`
  
  - Example: `1.two-sum-johndoe.py`
  - Use hyphens (`-`) to separate words in the problem name.
  - Use your GitHub username for attribution.
- **One solution per file**: Each file should contain the solution to a single problem.
- **README updates**: If you add a new language directory, update this README with the new language.
- **Code quality**: Please ensure your code is readable and well-commented.
